# eSUP
HW and FW for motorized stand up paddle board (SUP). Includes BMS+Charger, MCU, and Battery-Holder PCBA designs.

## High-Level Block Diagram
Some aspects still TBD, but this is the general idea so far. BMS+Charger PCBA, Battery-Holder PCBAs, and MCU PCBA. May or may not need another custom PCBA for hand controller, might be possible to directly use or modify an OTS hand controller normally used for electric foil boards or skateboards.
