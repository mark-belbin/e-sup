# eSUP
HW and FW for motorized stand up paddle board (SUP). Includes BMS+Charger, MCU, and Battery-Holder PCBA designs.

## Motivation
1. Cruise around Foster City on a battery powered electric SUP.
2. Learn more about BMS HW and design.
3. Improve STM32 FW skills and knowledge.

## High-Level Block Diagram
Some aspects still TBD, but this is the general idea so far. BMS+Charger PCBA, Battery-Holder PCBAs, and MCU PCBA. May or may not need another custom PCBA for hand controller, might be possible to directly use or modify an OTS hand controller normally used for electric foil boards or skateboards.
